This Python code implements a basic Library Management System with a graphical user interface using the Tkinter library. It consists of two classes: Library, which manages a list of available and borrowed books, and LibraryManagementApp, which provides a user interface for actions such as borrowing, returning, and managing books. Users can interact with the system to display available books, borrow or return books, check for overdue books, add new books, and exit the application. This system enables simple book management and user interactions in a user-friendly GUI.
